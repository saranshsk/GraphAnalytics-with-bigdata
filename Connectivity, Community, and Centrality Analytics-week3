Question 1

1. Question 1

The example given in the lectures of when a power network loses power in large portions of its service area was an example of what?



high levels of connectivity which make it easy to bring a network down



a problem that can occur when centrality is too high



an attack which causes disconnection of the graph 

Correct 

Question 2

2. Question 2

Is the following graph strongly connected, weakly connected or neither?





weakly connected

This should not be selected 

Hint: directionality of edges doesn't matter in identifying weakly connected graphs. See this video to review.



strongly connected



neither

weakly connected

Correct 



strongly connected



neither

4. Question 4

If you were going to look for a node which would be most likely to be the target of an attack to disconnect a network, what would be the best characteristic to look for?



low degree nodes



nodes that, if they were removed, would cause the graph to go from strongly connected to weakly connected



high degree nodes

Correct

7. Question 7

In the graph below, which nodes are the greatest communicators? (Hint: there's a tie)




A

Correct 

Right, A has out-degree 2 and in-degree 2.



B

Un-selected is correct 



C

Correct 

Right, C has out-degree 2 and in-degree 2.



D

Un-selected is correct 

Question 8
Correct1 / 1 points
8. Question 8

What would we be looking for if we followed the steps below? Note: we have 2 graphs.1.Create a table for each graph where, for each node, you list the degree of the node.2.For each graph, create a histogram indicating how many nodes in that graph have a specific degree (e.g., how many nodes have degree 1? 2? etc.).3.Use advanced approaches (e.g. Euclidean distances) to compare these two histograms.

9. Question 9

Which of the following are the three type of analytics questions asked about communities?



Static

10. Question 10

What type of community analytics question is the following?
Did a community form on twitter around the 2014 World Cup in Brazil?

11. Question 11

Which type of community analytics question is the following?
How tightly knit was the 2014 World Cup twitter community on July 13, 2014 (the day of the finals)?



Evolution

Static

Correct 



Connection

Question 12
Incorrect0 / 1 points
12. Question 12

What is the internal degree of the node indicated in the graph below?




1

This should not be selected 

Hint: Internal vs. External degree has to do with whether you count edges within the component or outside the component. See this video to review.

Question 13

13. Question 13

Which of the two graphs below is more modular? 





A



B

Correct 

Question 14
Incorrect0 / 1 points
14. Question 14

Which of the following community tracking phases best describes what (usually) happens a few months after two companies merge?



Merge



Birth



Death



Split



Grow

This should not be selected 

Hint: While the final graph of the company is bigger than either of the original 2, it is not likely that the overall number of nodes is greater than the sum of the 2 originally. See this video to review.

Question 15
Correct1 / 1 points
15. Question 15

An influencer in a network is defined as:



the biggest gossip in the network



a node which can reach all other nodes quickly

Correct 



a node which has heavy weight edges to at least 1/2 of the nodes in the network

Question 16
Correct1 / 1 points
16. Question 16

Which of the following are the 2 core “key player” problems that centrality analytics can address? 



A set of nodes which can reach (almost) all other nodes 

Correct 



Which nodes' removal will maximally disrupt the network

Correct 



What is the shortest path through a network 

Un-selected is correct 



Which nodes have the highest ratio of out-degree nodes to in-degree nodes 

Un-selected is correct 

Question 17
