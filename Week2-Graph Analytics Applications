2. Question 2

In a network representing the world wide web nodes would likely represent:



Hyperlinks



Webpages

Correct 

This is the content we would want to document relations between.



Google search terms



Individual computers

Question 3

3. Question 3

In a network representing the world wide web edges (or links) would likely represent



Hyperlinks

Correct 

Since one webpage links to another using hyperlinks, these edges (or links) would likely be represented by edges between nodes.



Webpages



Google search terms



Individual computers

4. Question 4

In an email network, which might reasonably be represented by weight on edges?



the total number of emails sent by one user in a week



average number of emails sent from one user to another in a week

Correct 



the total number of people who sent an email in a week

Question 5

5. Question 5

A loop in a graph is where:



when there is a edge from A->B, there is also an edge from B->A.



where there is a path in some way from a node, through 1 or more other nodes, back to the original node.

This should not be selected 

See this video to brush up.



where there is an edge from a node to itself.

Question 6

6. Question 6

An example of a loop in a graph could occur when:



Someone emails themself



Someone emails a friend who replies



Someone emails a friend, who emails another friend, who then replies to you

This should not be selected 

Hint: each of the other friends would be additional nodes. See this video to brush up.

7. Question 7

When trying to represent a relationship between Maria and Julio who have more than one relationship to each other (e.g., tennis partner, co-worker, emergency contact) which of the following would be needed in a graph representing those relationships



Separate graphs for each kind of relationship



Multiple edges between Maria and Julio

Correct 



Multiple nodes for each of Maria and Julio, to capture the various relationships

8. Question 8

In many applications paths (where we go from one node to another without repeating nodes) are more useful than walks (where we can repeat a node when going from one node to another).



True

Correct 



False

Question 9

9. Question 9

Trails (paths without repeated edges) can be interesting in which of the following problem applications?



An email network tracing frequency of emails from one person to another.



Routing to avoid visiting the same city.



Routing to avoid using the same bridge or road.



An email network tracing email replies.

This should not be selected 

This may involve repeated responses, which would require repeating edges. See this video to review this concept.

Question 10

10. Question 10

Suppose we have an email network where the edges of a graph represent the number of emails from one user to another. 
If I was going to ask if Maria had sent any emails that (either directly or through forwarding from others) reached Julio, I would ask if:



Julio’s node was reachable from Maria node

Correct 



Maria’s node was reachable from Julio’s node

11. Question 11

If I want to find the diameter of a graph, I should start by finding the shortest path between each set of nodes.



True

Correct 



False

Question 12

12. Question 12

What is the diameter of this graph?





1

This should not be selected 

Hint: The diameter is the longest "shortest path" between any set of nodes. See this video to review this concept.

13. Question 13

This question is about "best paths". To find the most discussed email in an email network, would we be looking to minimize a function or maximize a function?



Maximize

Correct 

The "optimization function" we would want is to maximize the length of a reply path based off the sending of one email.



Minimize

14. Question 14

Which are the two kinds of constraints on paths discussed in the video on basic path analytics? (check 2) Hint: remember the example of Amarnath needing to get to work by taking his son to school.



Directionality

Un-selected is correct 



Inclusion of nodes and/or edges

Correct 

For example, if one must stop by a given location on your route to someplace else. See this video to review. (The Basic Path Analytics Problem)



Exclusion of nodes and/or edges

Correct 

For example, if one will not use toll-roads. See this video to review. (The Basic Path Analytics Problem)

Which of the statements below is true?



Dijsktra's algorithm is computationally efficient (has low computational complexity).

17. Question 17

In the video on "Inclusion and Exclusion Constraints" we learn that adding constraints can actually make our analysis job easier. For example, when we require that a given node be included on a path, which of the following impacts now make the analysis job easier? (Choose 2)



Splitting the task into 2 independent shortest path problems

Correct 

And these can be solved in parallel -- at the same time.



Changing the weights on the edges of the graph and/or subgraphs

Un-selected is correct 



Reduction of the size of the graph

Correct 

There may be only parts of the complete graph that are relevant, given constraints.
